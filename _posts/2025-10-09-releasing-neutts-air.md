Last week at Neuphonic we released NeuTTS Air, a small LLM-based TTS model aimed at people who're interested in deploying smaller TTS models on-device. The response has been fantastic - we've amassed just over ~50k huggingface downloads and ~2.5k github stars over the past week. As I'm writing this we're trending #1 on all huggingface models! Not bad for a 5-person pre-seed company :)
