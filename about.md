I'm a Machine Learning Engineer based in the UK. 

Previously, I've worked at a couple of startups building out machine learning solutions from proof of concept to production, across a wide range of domains (tabular classification, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, natural language processing, langauge model agents).

**I'm currently looking for a new role based in London.**
