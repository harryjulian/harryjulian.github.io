I'm a Machine Learning Engineer based in the UK.

I like solving complex real-world problems with machine learning. I'm a big fan of JAX and Rust (when I'm not wrestling with their sharp edges).

I'm currently looking for a new role, **based in London or remote**. If you're hiring for a role you think I'd be a good fit for, shoot me a message on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harry-julian-7bab57166/).
