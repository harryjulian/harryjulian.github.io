I'm a Machine Learning Engineer from the UK.

My formal academic background is in psychology and neuroscience, but I managed to get a little bit obsessed with machine learning somewhere along the way. 

In my current role, I spend most of my time working on large models for speech and language applications. When I'm trying to convince myself to have some work-life balance and I'm not working on machine learning projects in my spare time, I'm probably running.

# Research Interests
- Biolgically inspired deep learning.
- Large model compression.
- Reliable, hype-immune methods to translate LLMs into useful, user-focused products.
