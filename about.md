I'm Harry Julian, a Machine Learning Engineer based in the UK. 

My academic background is in experimental psychology and neuroscience; I got started in machine learning by training neural networks on brain imaging data. 

Since graduating, I've worked at a couple of startups, most recently spending my time i) working on creating effective, efficient and accurate LLM based products and ii) combining LLMs with speech-to-text/text-to-speech models to create full, naturalistic and conversational interactions with LLMs.

I've just taken a 6 month career break to travel South America and I've been busy seeing new sights, learning Spanish and reading some rather dense machine learning textbooks. 

I'm returning to the UK soon and actively looking for a new role based in London. If you think you or someone that you know is hiring for a role I'd be a good fit for, please get in touch via email.
