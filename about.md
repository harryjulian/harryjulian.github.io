### In Brief
I'm Harry Julian, a Machine Learning Engineer from Manchester. 

My academic background is in experimental psychology and neuroscience; I got started in machine learning by training neural networks on brain imaging data. 

Since graduating, I've worked at a couple of startups, and I currently spend most of my time working on large models for NLP and ASR.


### Research Interests
- How can we translate LLMs into useful, efficient, user-focused products?
- How does a Transformers compress it's training data? To what extent can we compress a Transformer? Are there any theoretical limits connecting the answers to these questions?
- Biologically-inspired deep learning.
